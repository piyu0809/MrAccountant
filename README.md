# MrAccountant

## Who is Mr. Akountant?
- Mr. Akountant is a google assistant application which I build at BigRed Hack 2018. It helps user to keep track of the expenses.
- Users can talk to Mr. Akountant using voice commands and he will save the expenses in the particular category. Later, user can ask Mr. Akountant how much did they spend on a particular category in any given time.
- Google DialogFlow converts voice commands into http request which invokes AWS lambda function in the backend. Expenses are stored in Postgresql.
